title: JJRC H67 - flashing ACRO (Silverware by NotFastEnuf)
---

Recently I successfully flashed ACRO firmware into my JJRC H67. It wasn't easy, but I will show you how you can do it.

To do the whole procedure, you will need:
- ST-LINK V2,
- ST-LINK Utility app,
- and some cables.

Then you go through the steps listed on the [RCGroups forum][rcgroups], but instead of BoldClash-BWHOOP-B-03 precompiled firmware, you will use [this binary](/assets/h67.hex). It is a compiled [Silverware by NotFastEnuf][nfe] with the following config:
```c
#define BWHOOP
#define RX_BAYANG_PROTOCOL_TELEMETRY_AUTOBIND
#define USE_MULTI
// #define ARMING CHAN_5
```

If you are a Mac user, you are going to do some steps differently. You will need [Silverware Tools for macOS](https://simonernst.com/silverware/) since ST-LINK Utility is Windows-only software.

- in step "Erasing the factory firmware" instead of ST-LINK Utility user Unlocker to unlock the chip on your flight controller,
- in step "Flashing a new firmware" use the Flasher app. You just drag and drop your firmware file (e.g.: `h67.hex`) into the app's window.

After this whole procedure, you will be able to bind to your Taranis as I described [here]({% post_url 2019-07-24-jjrc-h36-h67-taranis-multiprotocol %}).

I also gathered some additional materials you may find useful:
